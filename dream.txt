I want to create a visual orchestrator for working with many AI agents to achieve various tasks, because I am lazy, af.

So the thought is right now it's fairly easy to make quick progress with claude code as-is. I want to make it easier to extend how plugins and agents are used, as well as MCP endpoints via a web-ui.

Right now we are establishing the backend queue system and how the application establishes communication with worker nodes.

I want to use 0mq

We need the following rough structures

./worker
- Connects to configured backend
./backend
- Persistence layer, access control, rest backend
./ui
- Graphical node based workflow configuration layer
- worker configuration layer
- mcp configuration layer
- claude configuration layer
./integrations
- runtimes for running containers and getting gpu resources in the mix
