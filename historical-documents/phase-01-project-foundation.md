# Phase 1: Project Foundation

> **Status**: COMPLETE
> **Goal**: Basic project structure, can run both frontend and backend

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Initialize Python project with uv
- [x] Set up FastAPI with basic health endpoint
- [x] Initialize Svelte project with Vite
- [x] Configure CORS, proxy for dev
- [x] Set up SQLite with SQLAlchemy models
- [x] Docker Compose for local dev

## Deliverable

`docker-compose up` runs both services

## Tech Decisions Made

- **Backend**: FastAPI for async Python API
- **Frontend**: Svelte + Vite for reactive UI with fast builds
- **Database**: SQLite + SQLAlchemy for simple persistence
- **Containers**: Docker Compose for local development
