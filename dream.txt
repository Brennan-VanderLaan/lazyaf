I want to create a visual orchestrator for working with many AI agents to achieve various tasks, because I am lazy, af.

I am a devops engineer and I want to embrace a sane SDLC.

Branches
Dev -> QA -> Prod

For developing a new feature, a new branch is created off of Dev
The feature is then implemented, and tested. Once tests are passing it can merge into Dev via PR.

When new commits land in dev they kick off integration tests / update the dev release artifacts (if any) to reflect the new commit

After a series of feature(s) land a promotion happens from dev -> QA
Integration tests are carried out, manual human review steps are carried out

On acceptance, a new version is released in prod

We are creating a ui that allows users to land feature requests.
